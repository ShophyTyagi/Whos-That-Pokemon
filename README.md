# Whos-That-Pokemon-
The project is used to train a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras and Deep Learning to crate a Pokemon classifier. 
For now the pokemon that can be classified are 
1. Bulbasaur
2. Charmander 
3. Pikachu
4. Squirtle 
5. Mewtwo 

The dataset for this project can be built with the help of [this](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/04/09/how-to-quickly-build-a-deep-learning-image-dataset/) article. 

### Model Used
The model used for training is a custom model designed using the structure of VGGNet. The code for the model is found in [smallervggnet.py](https://github.com/shophy26/Whos-That-Pokemon-/blob/main/smallervggnet.py) script.
You can read more about VGGNet from [here](https://becominghuman.ai/what-is-the-vgg-neural-network-a590caa72643).
